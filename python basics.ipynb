Can keywords be used as variable name?\n"," - No keywords cannot be used as variable name.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in python?\n","  - Objects and container whose state or value can be changed after they created are mutability in python.\n","\n","6.why are lists mutable,but tuples are immutable?\n"," - In lists their are no set of rules which means we can change their values without changing their identities. While, in tuples there is different thing If you will try to change their values then there identity will get affected.\n","\n","Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","- The “==” operator is used to compare the value of the variable.\n"," \t\tExample:\n","\t\t\tname = \"vijay\"\n","      if name==\"vijay\":\n","  \t\t\t\tprint(\"name is present\")\n","\t\t\telse:\n","\t\t\t\t  print(\"name is not present\")\n","\n","- The “is” operator is use to compare the memory locations of two objects. It returns True if the two objects have the same location , and False otherwise.\n","\t\tExample:\n","      a = [1,2,3]\n","      b = [1,2,3]\n","      c=a\n","      print(a is b)\n","      print(a is c)\n","\n","Q8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","- logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and evaluate them as a single boolean expression.\n","\n","\n","There are three types of logical operators in Python:-\n","- and\n","- or\n","- not\n","\n","Q9.What is type casting in Python?\n","- The process of changing the data type of a value or object\n","It is used to correct the mismatch of data type in the value or object.\n","\n","Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","- Implicit type conversion is performed by a Python interpreter only. While, Explicit type conversion is performed by the user by explicitly using type conversion functions in the program code.It is also known as typecasting.\n","\n","Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","- A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. Like, in real life if one condition is not fulfilled, you will do something else. Similarly it goes to the programming language also if one condition is not TRUE the cod will execute to other parts of the condition.\n","\n","Example:-\n","\n","\t\t\tage = 15\n","      if age >= 18:\n","  \t\t\tprint(\"You will be served alcohal\")\n","      else:\n","   \t\t\t print(\"get out of the bar\")\n","\n","Q12. How does the elif statement work?\n","- In conditional statements the elif word stands for “else if” , it is use to check multiple condition. Like ,  if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n","\n","Example:-\n","\n","    age = 80\n","    if age < 18:\n","        print(\"You are minority\")\n","    elif 18<age<=65:\n","        print(\"Yo are adult\")\n","    else:\n","         print(\"You are senior citizen\")\n","\n","Q13.  What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","- A “for” loop is used for iterating over a sequence. While , with the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.\n","\n","Q14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","- Use of \"for\" loop when you know the loop will be executed for short or 'n' no times. Use of \"while\" loop for reading a file which are mentioned in a variable. Use a while loop when asking for user input.\n","\n","\n","   "],"metadata":{"id":"gjRwtlGuaV-B"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"1rz6Gv1EuZ3K"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Practical question\n","'''\n","Q1.
